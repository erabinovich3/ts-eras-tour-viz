# Taylor Swift The Eras Tour Visualization

This is a visualization of where Taylor Swift has performed throughout The Eras Tour as well as what surprise songs she performed at each show.

The surprise songs also show the corresponding color for the album that they are from. In the case of a mashup, a gradient of the corresponding album colors is used.

Desktop or landscape mode are best for viewing.
